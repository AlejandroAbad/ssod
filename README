SINGLE SIGN-ON DAEMON
Daemon that will automatically obtain roaming TGTs when accessing a federated
network while in a roaming realm.

This software will search in all available interfaces with an active 
wpa_supplicant control interface for a negotiated MSK to generate a
username/password for the visited realm KDC.

This is part of a project related to single sign-on authentication
and authoritation for cloud access in federated scenarios, being developed
in the Universiry of Murcia (Spain)
